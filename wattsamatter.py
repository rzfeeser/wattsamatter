This project queries the https://poweroutage.us database and returns those counties within the United States
experiencing outages set above the THRESHHOLD.

This script is not intended for commercial use and is intended only for educational purposes. Please check out poweroutage.us for source data, as that is where this code pulls data from.

https://poweroutage.us provides a RESTFUL API for commercial users.

Commercial users should navigate to https://poweroutage.us/products and provide support to this project. It is the
**ONLY** source of near-real-time aggregated electric grid data available within the US. Please support the project.

Installation considerations:
    Before running this script, you must install the requests library. This can be accomplished with the command:
        python3 -m pip install requests

    For more information about the requests library, check out:
        - https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/
        - https://pypi.org/project/requests/


If you do use this script, I only ask that you leave my original proof of authorship. Oh, and maybe hire me to be your
next trainer or consultant :)

Thanks,
  -Zach
